Mailinglist
-----------
There's a mailinglist.

to subscribe.


Tips
----
You can also use MultiTail to view logfiles on other hosts!
How?
Like this:
multitail -l "ssh username@host tail -f file"
Q: but then I cannot enter the password!
A1: use authentication via keys
A2: or use "ssh-agent": then you only once have to enter your passphrase (so login once
    to that host manually, and then start MultiTail)


Q & A
-----
Q: the program fails then resizing the terminal-window
A: solution: upgrade ncurses to version 5.3 (or more recent)

Q: when I use the -l option on some program, I get nothing in the window
A: now that is strange! please tell me what program you're trying to interface to MultiTail.
   please do: any help is appreciated!
